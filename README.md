## ARIMA-Based Weekly Sales Forecasting

### Overview
This project demonstrates the application of ARIMA and SARIMA modeling techniques for time series forecasting, focusing on weekly sales data. The primary objective is to analyze historical sales trends, evaluate stationarity, tune model parameters, and forecast future sales with accuracy.

Key steps in this project include:
- Data loading, preprocessing, and merging.
- Stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
- Model selection using grid search for ARIMA and SARIMA parameters.
- Model evaluation with metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- Visualizations of sales trends and forecast result
